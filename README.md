# ABOUT
Functional Programming (Haskell) basics (recursion, lists, higher order functions, folding, datatypes, typeclasses, maybe variables, QuickCheck, IO).


# HOW TO
- Set up the environment for Haskell
- Test the functions from any file. For example, for PF_final.hs: 
  - **ghci** PF_final.hs
  - Everytime you modify the content of the file, type in the terminal: **:r**
  - Actually test the function, example:  showLast [1,3,2]
  - Test operations on newly created datatypes, example: (==) Zero1 Zero1
